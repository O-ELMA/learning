                        The following documentation is written under the assumption that you are in no way affeliated with the UL agents and have no prior knowledge to the technology used within your current location, its implications, or its reach. It's explains in great detail everything you need to know about the systems before you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, by any chance, you are a survivine agent, then you may start the wakening of the AI within the mainframe unit. It is equiped with psychic sensors within which you can input memories of utility in order to bring it up to speed. It has currently been <code id="time"></code> hours since it was shut down for energy recovery. Please refrain from doing so if there is any doubt within your mind that you may not be equiped enough to operate it. UL agents are not capable of resisting psychic shock on the off chance of link break. You too should read the documentation.

                        <b>Clyto-Tech Control Center</b> is a mobile base designed to <i>welcome</i> designated operators and provide all the paramount equipment they require for managing the Wall and its modules. Amongst other things, you have control over several billion cells that compose the barrier between you and the rest of the planet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aforementioned barrier is a wall that was meant to contain the island within, alongside a potential threat detected within its grounds. Both the residents of the island and the rest of the known civilisation did not know the outcome of the ongoing contagion. Extinction was presumed after the disappearance of The Well. Nevertheless, the wall was made to stop whichever threat became prominent first, protecting both sides from what resides in the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the controlbase from which you can change settings of large influence within the Wallâ€™s Edge. You may select from a variety of options, including, but not limited to, dividing the borders within, isolation sections, weaponizing Wall Cells, and most importantly, portal creation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The many features available to you within this base is explained thoroughly in this documentation.
